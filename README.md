# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
A looming wave of retirees presents challenges and opportunities for Pewlett-Hackard. There is a substantial number of employees who will be of retirement age, and P-H must be prepared. We need to be mindful of filling positions which will be vacated, and training our new recruits with select employees who are eligible to be mentors.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

	-More than 90,000 people are approaching retirement age
	-P-H needs to prepare for changing workforce
	-1550 employees are eligible for our mentorship program
	-More data needed for consideration of positions which do not need replacement


Summary:

	A mind-boggling 90,398 employees are approaching the age of retirement. Pewlett-Hackard needs to anticipate this 'silver tsunami' and prepare to fill these positions, as well as train new-hires. We currently have 1550 employees approaching retirement age who are eligible to be mentors for these trainees. As it stands, the ratio of trainees to mentors is nearly 60-to-1, which is quite a bit less than ideal. Our original intent was to have as much one-on-one interaction as possible, but with this ratio this does not seem possible. We recommend either expanding mentorship eligibility, or rethinking the program to include more group training.
